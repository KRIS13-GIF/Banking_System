# Banking_System


The idea of this small project is using Object Oriented Concepts of Java by implementin polymorphism and relation between 
classes and subclasses. Data Structure used : Arrays.

The code is not in GUI , but it helps in understanding the concepts how classes cooperate with each other.

A customer opens a bank account with initial balance 100$.
The options that he can do are: deposit, withdraw. add client(Object Array) , show balance.
The first time it withdraws the fees are 0. If you withdraw money from the bank, it is mandatory by default that the minimum amount of 100$ remains inside in the account of the client.
All the operations are done by being linked to the Account Number.It is considered as a unique key for each customer.
Next we have a static variable which influences on the balance.
